The facehugger pods will attach themselves to anything, from a human, a dog, and even a Predator. They lay the eggs inside the hosts chest and in a few hours will burst from the chest. The baby xenomorph is vaguely wormlike but they quickly grow to maturity in a matter of hours. This means the same Alien can appear as different forms of itself. Their physical ablities and appearance depend on the host it came from. They are bulletproof and even if you are able to injure it it's blood is acidic and will burn through anything. (note: it's unclear whether or not it's actually blood or just a defense mechanism in the Alien body).
They possesses an exoskeleton much like that of a lobster, impenetrable to everything but the most powerful human firearms (12-gauge shotguns, Pulse Rifles, and stanchion launchers are quite effective). Another weakness is extreme heat weapons, such as a molotov or flamethrower.  High-energy beam weapons, such as the plasma weapons used by Yautja, appear to be the best way to kill the Xenomorphs. However they are intelligent and fast-learners, so don't expect the same thing to work twice. Also NEVER, EVER, attack an Alien in close quarters. It's "attack tongue" can pierce through anything, even Predator armor, it's claws are razor sharp, and it's tail is just as deadly. </h1>
<h2>The Thing.
This alien parasite is possibly the most danerous thing in fiction. It feeds on it's victims and can replicate their bodies and memories, making it a master of disguise. The Thing has been known to have 2 weaknesses. It can't replicate something that isn't organic, like prosthetics, and extreme heat. If you're in a room with lots of people and don't know who it is, take a blood test and poke the blood with a hot rod. This has been shown to agitate the blood and make it go back to the main body which is The Thing. When you find it, use a flamethrower and make sure NOTHING of it survives as it can regenerate. No picture is provided due to it's shapeshifting properties.

Deadites

These demoic entities who have possessed normal humans are dangerous if you don't know what to do. The main weakness is the brain, like any other zombie, but they can still manipulate their limbs even after losing them. Only a complete decimation of the brain has been known to kill a deadite. However, they have a hivemind, so after killing one, the rest will be after you. Explosives and high-calibur are your friends. An odd weakness is their self inflicted injuries. It's unclear if it's a scare tactic or if they enjoy feeling pain. Also, getting the demon out will remove all injuries that person has endured under the possession.  Aside Kandarian Dagger and sunlight, the most effective method in killing them was by dismembeing their host. They also cannot possess the dismembered corpse as well.
