<h1>
The Overlook Hotel. This building in the Rocky Mountains with a dangerous past should be avoided. If you're the caretaker that is. The original caretaker killed his entire family and then himself. The newer one Jack Torrance and his family took the winter job which involved staying at the hotel for about 5 months. When Jack's son danny is told by the chef Dick Halloran that he and Danny have a gift known as Shining. Afterwards Danny meets the Grady Twins, the kids of the last caretaker, who was their father and murderer. The hotel also slowly made Jack begin to go insane, enough to try to kill his own family. Apparently the hotel feeds on the people that enter it, those who Shine are exceptionallly useful, as it uses these souls to become more powerful. Theories suggest that the hotel is a manifestation of Pennywise the Dancing Clown who will get its own entry. In order to survive the Overlook, simply don't take the job. If you do, go with lots of people. Also the hedges have been known to come to life when unobserved so be careful for that.</h1>

<h2>
Pennywise, The Dancing Clown
This demonic being, hailing from a realm beyond time and space, known as the macroverse, has killed an unknown but large amount of people. The majority being innocent children. Known as It by the Loser's Club, Pennywise wakes every 30 or so years to cause as much chaos as possible, feed on the people's fear, and to kill. It is a shapeshifter, psychic, likely immortal but has an exploitable weakness. It's psychically sensitive and therefore can be injured by anything if you truly believe it can hurt it. This was shown when Eddie Kaspbrak shot It with his inhaler imagining it's battery acid. You can also starve it with courage and heart and that will make it weaker.

This.. man..? For lack of a better word has been a serial killer since he was a child and killed his sister. For no apparent reason. He has been locked up in mental prisons and escaped multiple times to kill any babysitter he sees. All jokes aside it's rumored that he may be the embodiment of evil itself by his doctor. However he is still human if it's not the curse of thorn story. The best way to kill him is simple. Shoot him, or preferably a decapitation then burn the remains. just to be safe. He has rumored stregnth and regeneration so be careful.
