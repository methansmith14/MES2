<h1> The Yautja,aka The Predator
These advanced alien hunters are the best of the best. Their initiations include hunting xenomorphs, which are in the monster section. They hunt the most dangerous and what they consider worthy prey, including humans. The Predators have one main weakness that is obvious. They aren't bulletproof or regenerate. They keep medicinal supplies in case of injuries. They also have a cloaking field which makes them invisible, or at least partially. If you lay down your weapons, and are just a simple person, then they won't hunt you. Again they only hunt "worthy" prey.

<img src = "http://horrorfreaknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/0-Jason.jpg" />
This poor child who was drowned in Camp Crystal Lake for his hydrosymphalic head, didn't die. Instead he returned as the mute murderer of Crystal Lake. There's 3 main versins of Jason Voorhees. The first, human Jason, has above average strength from training and living in the woods. He's still human just has some pain tolerance. Even attacking his male weak point has shown effective. Zombie Jason after his ressurection, is an immortal, superstrong, regenerative, killer. No known methos has been shown to kill him permanently. However, he can be drowned in Crystal Lake waters. Keep him chained up down there and he should be fine. Uber Jason, however, has shown no weakness and even survives the vacuum of space from the future nanobots healing him in Jason x. He may still be weak to Crystal Lake waters but since the lake has dried up at the time he may be unstoppable. However, he will return to the remains and likely live the rest of the days alone. simply don't go to Camp Crystal Lake.

While in your dreams, he has full control over everything. If you stay brave you will drain his power and make him weaker. However he will get mad and try to attack you. If you have a trap in the real world, and bring him out, you can injure him pretty badly. However, this will not kill him but he will know not to attack you.. anymore that is. </h3>
<h4> Charles Lee Ray, aka Chucky the Killer Doll
<img src= "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/chuckychildsplay/images/0/06/Chucky_7_1050_591_81_s_c1.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/214?cb=20171025070016" style=height:300px;width:500px; /> Though appearing as a harmless doll, the serial killer Charles Lee ray actually transferred his soul into the Good Guy doll. He has full control of what he does and tries to find a new body, preferably the body of a young child. He wants to be a real boy. He may be as light as a doll but he has the strength of a fully grown man. He can be kille but his soul can be sent to another good guy doll, and even more than one. The best way to stop him is to remove the limbs, decapitate the doll, and keep the head locked up. He can't completely be stopped but it really isn't hard to stop him.
